    <h1>Climate change projections by constituency over Great Britain</h1>
    <h4>These projections are taken from the Met Office's <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp">UKCP18 dataset</a>. They represent the change in the climate for the years 2051-2080 (so roughly 2065) compared to 1981-2010. These change are the average of an 'ensemble' of climate models with different physics that are then downscaled to an spatial grid of 12km. The projections use a scenarios of global carbon emissions called RCP8.5, which thankfully we are currently not following. The changes that are currently available to look at are:
    <ul>
      <li> annual mean change in rainfall (in mm/day) </li>
      <li> annual temperature change in oC </li>
      <li> difference in the number of days experiencing drought per year </li>
      <li> change in amount of rain falling over the wettest 5 days of the year (in mm, related to flooding)</li>
      <li> change in the number of days categorised as a heatwave by the regional publich health authorities </li>
      <li> How much hotter the warmest day of the average year will be in future (in oC) </li>
    </ul>
    Additionally you can see the observed rainfall anomaly in 2019 (in mm/day). This analysis of projections was undertaken by Georgia Willits as part of her dissertation research for her Climate Change MSc at UCL Geography. The hexmap code was written by <a href="https://open-innovations.org/projects/hexmaps/">Open Innovations</a> and deployed for this webpage by Hannah Woodward. Prof. Chris Brierley supervised the research.
