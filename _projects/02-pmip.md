I have acquired an international reputation around the modelling of past climate, through my leadership role within the Paleoclimate Model Intercomparison Project (PMIP4). I have a special responsibility for fostering research that crosses many different time periods and draws quantitative links to the future climate. PMIP is one of the longest running components of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) - which provides the climate projections for the influential IPCC assessment reports. PMIP involves over 200 researchers and over 20 different modelling centres across the globe. Within the CMIP6 protocol, there are five different experimental protocols (18) defined for different time periods in Earth’s history. I led the primary research paper for one of these experiments, the midHolocene (1, see Significant Publications). This was a collaboration between 17 different modelling centres and the palaeodata community to present and evaluate the simulations. My student and I have also played a key role in the primary research paper describing the last interglacial (47). I further organised and made a vital contribution to the only multi-experiment, multi-model PMIP4 paper published in time to be considered by the IPCC (6). These represent only the headline studies from the PMIP4 project – well over 100 papers were published from the previous iteration of the project and it has expanded since. 

My contributions to Palaeoclimate Model Intercomparison Project initially arose from the founding of a PMIP3 working group looking at climate variability in 2011. I hosted a workshop at UCL to initiate this effort in 2012. For PMIP4, there was a consolidation of the existing working groups and I became co-chair of the past2future-variability working group. This aligned to my interests of studying how we can use past changes in climate variability to inform future projections (e.g. 14,29). I hosted a small workshop at UCL in 2019 focused on analysing and writing up PMIP4 results in time for inclusion in the upcoming IPCC report. This UCL workshop has resulted 4 papers published so far (inc. 1,6,8). To enable this, I have invested time in developing the software for an efficient workflow to perform some standard analyses of the 100s of TB of available experimental data output. This has led to me being considered expert in the practical elements of the analyses, and I regularly field queries from researchers across the globe about it. My input was key to the organisation of the recent PMIP2020 meeting (held physically in Nanjing and remotely for >200 participants). I play a key, active role in deciding the future direction of the PMIP effort (for example, I chaired the relevant session at PMIP2020 conference). Through my research activity with PMIP, I have been invited to join the prestigious Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as a contributing author of its upcoming Assessment Report 6 (sect 10.5).
