The question of what climate we will experience in the future is a vital one, with many repercussions. Our interest is in how we quantify and explain uncertainty in climate research. As part of his PhD work, Damian [Oyarzún highlighted](http://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-018-4158-7) a common deficiency with projections used to inform planning around future marine productivity. Maryam Ilyas focused on uncertainty in sparse observation networks, which led to us introducing the [first probabilistic definition of El Niño](http://doi.org/10.1002/2017GL074596). Clair Barnes and [her work](http://doi.org/10.1002/qj.3632) on converting multiple models’ weather predictions into an accurate measure of forecast spread has led to UCL being contracted by the UK Met. Office to assess the fidelity of their projections for future UK climate. 

The OACD group has undertaken research on the impact of climate change across a range of disciplines, both by students and researchers. These have resulted in publications led by UCL Geography taught students on [groundwater](http://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-775-2020), future [river flows](http://doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2015.1057513), and [tropical cyclones](http://doi.org/10.3402/tellusa.v67.24474). We have been supported the efforts of UCL and latterly LSE to refresh and deploy the PAGE integrated assessment model (used for the Stern review on the Economics of Climate Change). Whilst these efforts are yet to fully reach fruition, we have undertaken consultancy work (for the UK Met. Office), published [research report](https://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/people/academic-staff/chris-brierley/ecrc_report_182_Bharadwaj_Brierley.pdf).
