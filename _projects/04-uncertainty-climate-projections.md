The question of what climate we will experience in the future is a vital one, with many repercussions. My interest is in how we quantify and explain uncertainty in climate research. With my PhD student, Damian Oyarzún, I have highlighted a common deficiency with projections used to inform planning around future marine productivity (4, see Significant Publications). I have co-supervised 2 PhD students with UCL Statistical Science on this topic. With Maryam Ilyas, and her focus on uncertainty in sparse observation networks, I have introduced the first probabilistic definition of El Niño (17). Clair Barnes and her work on converting multiple models’ weather predictions into an accurate measure of forecast spread (11) has led to UCL being contracted by the UK Met. Office to assess the fidelity of their projections for future UK climate. 

I have supported UCL research on the impact of climate change across a range of disciplines, both by students and researchers. These have resulted in publications led by UCL Geography taught students on groundwater (7), future river flows (24), and natural hazards (30). I have long supported the efforts of UCL and latterly LSE to refresh and deploy the PAGE integrated assessment model (used for the Stern review on the Economics of Climate Change). Whilst these efforts are yet to reach fruition, we have undertaken consultancy work (for the UK Met. Office), published reports (21) and have submitted research on the topic (Kikstra et al, The social cost of carbon dioxide under climate-economy feedbacks and temperature variability, Nature Comms).
