I have been actively engaged in interdisciplinary research on the role of humans in Earthâ€™s history. I have contributed both ideas and modelling expertise to this developing topic through collaborations across UCL with archaeologists, geologists and geneticists. My expertise on the Plio-Pleistocene climate has led to my invitation to collaborate on research around climate impacts on Human evolution (e.g. 31). I have also fostered uniquely interdisciplinary research on the impacts that human actions have had on the climate system prior to industrialisation. These have included questioning the existing discussions around the collapse of the green Sahara around 5,500 years ago, which had not entertained an anthropogenic role before, despite coinciding with a proposed start date for the Anthropocene (3, see Significant Publications). Related to a different proposed start date, my PhD student, Alex Koch, explored the role of the colonisation of the Americas on the global climate (2, see Significant Publications).
