# A collection of climate researchers based at University College London

The ocean atmosphere climate dynamics group at University College London researches the important aspects of how the climate system works. 

It is led by a group of academics in the Departments  of Geography and Earth Sciences at UCL. It combines research techniques at the cutting edge of the laboratory-based geoscience and computer modelling. It has worked on topics stretching from the equator to the pole and from millions of years ago to the coming centuries. We have particular expertise on the deep circulation of the North Atlantic and the Multi model ensembles of past climate change.
