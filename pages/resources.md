## Facilities

The [Physical Geography laboratories](https://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/resources/laboratory) are located in the basement of the North-West Wing. The laboratories house a wide range of facilities for the analysis of waters, sediments, soils and other environmental materials.

The [Bloomsbury Environmental Isotope Facility (BEIF)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bloomsbury-environmental-isotope-facility/) houses 2 continuous-flow (ThermoFisher Delta V) mass spectrometers with a variety of peripheral systems capable of measuring stable isotopes (δ2H, δ13C, δ15N, δ18O, and  δ34S) generated from a variety of materials; a Cavity RingDown Spectrometer (Picarro L2130-i) for δ18O and δD in waters; and soon to come, a Nu Perspective IS, for clumped isotopes measurements in carbonates.

## Data

We have posted proxy reconstruction data on [Pangaea](https://pangaea.de/?q=Thornalley%2C+David+JR) and [NOAA Paleoclimate](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/study/search.json?dataPublisher=NOAA&investigators=Thornalley%2C%20D.J.R.&headersOnly=true)

The PMIPVarData website hosts a lot of post-processed output for both PMIP3 and PMIP4. It can be accessed through <http://www2.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~ucfaccb/past2future/>.

## Code
Our group is one of the maintainers of the [PMIP4 organisation on GitHub](https://pmip4.github.io/). This aims to gather together a selection of codes used to analyse the output from the Palaeoclimate Model Intercomparison Project. 

Our various GitHub usernames can be found on the [People](./about.md) tab.
